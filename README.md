# 🤔 What's Purplewood?
![logo](img/logo.png)

Purplewood is a very small discord bot i wrote primarily for 2 reasons, 1 to better understand the [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) discord bot framework for rust. And to help out a friend group of mine that needed a better recruitment logging system for their discord server

# 🎉 Features
- **Recruitment based logging for my friends server?** ✔ 
- **A credit system?** ✔
- **Bakes you a cake?** ❌

## This project is still a heavy wip 
Some planned features that may or may not happen are things like
- Sql intergration
- Web scraping to pull ingame user data like economy
- Administration tools like being able to look up certain logs/recruitments 
And anything else we think of down the line
